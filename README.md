# Elevator-Optimising-Using-Machine-Learning
Project developed for NTU DeepLearning Hackathon

## Existing Algorithms for Elevator Control
1. FCFS: First Come First Serve
2. SSTF: Shortest Seek Time First
3. SCAN: 
   
## Development
Aim: Develop an algorithm to control TRADITIONAL ELEVATOR based on Machine Learning to beat SSTF and SCAN.
> Traditional Elevator: one elevator, no group control

TODOs
* Decide on a Machine Learning Algorithm
* Decide on what parameters we should consider.
