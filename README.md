# Elevator-Optimising-Using-Machine-Learning
Project developed for NTU DeepLearning Hackathon

## Existing Algorithms for Elevator Control
1. FCFS: First Come First Serve
2. SSTF: Shortest Seek Time First
3. SCAN: 
   
## Development
Aim: Develop an algorithm to control TRADITIONAL ELEVATOR based on Machine Learning to beat SSTF and SCAN.
> Traditional Elevator: one elevator, no group control

TODOs
* Decide on a Machine Learning Algorithm
* Decide on what parameters we should consider.

Flow of events
1. Separating the dataset to train and test
2. EDA: histograms, box plots on floors
3. EDA: Time distribution by hour, day, week, if possible (generate time series)
4. 


## Model
* Prediction problem: predict where the elevator is gonna stop
* Consider factors like: work calendar, weather (raining then less people using elevator)
